# Prework Study Guide webpage

## Description

I wanted to learn the basics of website creation. I was keen to ensure I could follow all steps in the Prework course accurately.
I wanted to create the Study Guide webpage as my first test website.
The creation addressed the problem of moving me on from the stage of complete beginner and to start to understand use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.
I learned some of the basics in these areas but also learned that I will need constant practice to be able to remember them.

## Installation
n/a

## Usage

When the website opens, there are some reminders and tips about each aspect: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git.
If we open the DevTools console, we can see the JavaScript running, listing the topics we have been learning in Prework and choosing one topic for us to study first.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
